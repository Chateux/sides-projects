# Side project

### How to launch

You started the docker-compose for the **react front**

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Then you started the server **Golang**
```sh
$ cd server
$ make run
```

### What I have done

I did the first microservice. The first microservice makes it possible to put a task visible or not.
It was my first time with Golang.
